            <p>
                Messi has an extremely unique playstyle. His combination of low center of gravity dribbling, precise passing, and finishing
                is what makes him so great. You'll often see Messi walking around the pitch. The thing is, he isn't just walking around. He's
                scanning the spaces, analyzing defenders, and creating ideas in his head. His unique reading and controlling of the game
                is another aspect of him which makes him great.
            </p>
            <p>
                In soccer, attackers are meant to be the goalscorers. Messi is most definitely a goalscorer, but his playmaking style completes
                him as a player. He likes to drop deep to receive the ball. He does this to create something out of nothing.

                        These are only a few of the many milestones in Messi's career.

                    <p>
                    Messi's legacy is much more than goals and trophies. He is seen as a once-in-a-generation player, and there will not be a more
                    iconic rivalry, than the rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Messi holds many major accolades. He holds a record for most Ballon d'Or at 8, a record for most European Golden Shoes at 6, and
                        a record of 9 La Liga MVP awards. He recently won the World Cup with Argentina, the only major trophy he hadn't won.
